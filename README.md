# Hi, I‚Äôm @amalieshi. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
- Amalie is a German variant of the name Amalia. It is derived from the root word 'amal', meaning 'work' in German, 'hope' in Arabic and 'water' in Scots-Gaelic. 
- Like software product that gets updated constantly, I am updating my ideas quite constantly. - I am a spontaneous and free-spirited person. I like to explore different topics. I‚Äôm currently learning data science, discrete math, computational linear algebra, and computer science. My interests and hobbies are evolving steadily as time goes by. This description is just a snapshot of who I was at a certain time point as I was writing this article. I enjoy having a creative space to express who I am. My past has led me to who I am and I am not the person who I was. I take pride for having an open and curious mindset. The best things in life are unexpected. 
- My catchphrase is "c'est parti".

## Hobby
 I‚Äôm interested in reading British literature and solving puzzles. I like language learning and I am learning French and Japanese during my free time. I am hoping to travel to both countries when I can speak both languages fluently.


## A Short Bio
I grew up in Shenzhen, China. It is a city adjacent to Hong Kong. I later moved to the United States to complete my higher education. Surprisingly, I follow the alphabet in the city where I live, starting off with Atlanta, Georgia, and then Baltimore, Maryland. I love visiting the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC while living in Baltimore. I visited the British Embassy in Washington DC during one of the European Embassy Open Day pre-COVID and pre-Brexit. Out of all the European Embassies, I like the Great Britian the most because of the beautiful architecture and the well-tended garden. I also quite enjoy the Apple strudel from the Austria Embassy. I enjoyed the Fish and Chip and the Fairy Cake so much that I have decided to move to the UK.
 
After graduating from two of my favorite universities, I worked at a pharmaceutical manufacturing site near a waterfront town called Easton, Maryland. There I was close to two other towns - Cambridge, Maryland and Oxford, Maryland. I later move to New Jersey. I worked at the proximity of the once famous Bell Lab (now the Nokia site) and lived in Edison where Thomas Edison founded his first lab there. I visted two Thomas Edison's research laboratories in New Jersey. I also pay tribute to Nicola Tesla at the Radio Building and had a toast "Light Me Up" to him at the speakeasy called Patent Pending. I want to emulate Edison's grit and Tesla's ingenuity. 

I am now living in the very original Oxford in the United Kingdom, and I enjoy getting to know all the great British writers - namely, Shakespeare the bard, the Shelleys, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Virginia Woolf, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christine, and many more. Oxford is the city of dreaming spire, and I spend most of my time realizing my dream here. 


## Music and Movies
My favorite musicians are ZAZ, Stromae, Joyce Jonathan, Alizee, Clara Luciani, and Helene Rolles. I used to enjoy the music from Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Chloe Moriondo, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Cher, and Abba. My favourite actresses are Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, Jodie Comer, and Yuki Amami. I was quite into K-pop and J-pop in school, even though I had no idea what they were singing about. I used to enjoy musicals and theatres. From the East Village to the West End, I have seen a lot of theatre productions. C'est magnifique! ü•≥
