- Hi, I’m @amalieshi. The name Amalie is picked by myself. It is a German variant of the name Amalia. It is derived from the root word 'amal', meaning 'work' in German, 'hope' in Arabic and 'water' in Scots-Gaelic. I actually took the name "Amalie" as a blend of my favorite French movie "Amelie" and my favorite Japanese Actress "Yuki Amami".
- Like software product that gets updated constantly, I am updating my ideas quite constantly. My interests and hobbies are evolving steadily as time goes by. This description is just a snapshot of who I was at a certain time point as I was writing this article. I enjoy having a creative space to express who I am. My past has led me to who I am and I am not the person who I was. I take pride for having an open and curious mindset. The best things in life are unexpected. 
- I like language learning and I am learning French and Japanese during my free time. I am hoping to travel to both countries when I can speak both languages fluently so I don't have any travel plan right now. 
- I’m interested in reading British literature and solving puzzles. I grew up in Shenzhen, China. It is a city adjacent to Hong Kong. I later moved to the United States to complete my higher education. Surprisingly, I follow the alphabet in the city where I live, starting off with Atlanta, Georgia, and then Baltimore, Maryland. I love visiting the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC while living in Baltimore. I visited the British Embassy in Washington DC during one of the European Embassy Open Day pre-COVID and pre-Brexit. Out of all the European Embassies, I like the Great Britian the most because of the beautiful architecture and the well-tended garden. I also quite enjoy the Apple strudel from the Austria Embassy. I enjoyed the Fish and Chip and the Fairy Cake so much that I have decided to move to the UK. 
- After graduating from two of my favorite universities, I worked at a pharmaceutical manufacturing site near a waterfront town called Easton, Maryland. There I was close to two other towns - Cambridge, Maryland and Oxford, Maryland. I later move to New Jersey. I worked at the proximity of the once famous Bell Lab (now the Nokia site) and lived in Edison where Thomas Edison founded his first lab there. I am very inspired by my travel to his labs at the Menlo Park and the other larger one which is a national park. I visited the larger lab during one of the free national park days. Most of the early Hollywood movies are made there! The other perk of living in New Jersey is the proximity to the New York City where I saw a lot of modern art and Broadway shows. I also pay tribute to Nicola Tesla at the Radio Building and had a toast "Light Me Up" to him at the speakeasy called Patent Pending. I also get to visit Princeton University which is such a good school. 
- I am now living in the very original Oxford in the United Kingdom, and I enjoy getting to know all the great British writers - namely, Shakespeare the bard, the Shelleys, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Virginia Woolf, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christine, and many more. Oxford is the city of dreaming spire, and I spend most of my time realizing my dream here. 
- My favourite dessert is the Turkish delight (which I heard of in Narnia and I don't blame Edmund for betraying his family and Ashlan), gourmet cheese, and soft baked biscuits. My favourite TV shows are the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, 30 Rock, and Doctor Who. I am a huge fan of Tina Fey. Her character Liz Lemon in 30 Rock embodies the kind of role model that I aspire to be: sassy, funny, intelligent, nerdy, and hardworking. If I ever met her, I would be so starstruck. 
- I was quite into K-pop and J-pop in school, even though I had no idea what they were singing about. 
- I used to enjoy musicals and theatres. From the East Village to the West End, I have seen a lot of theatre production. C'est magnifique!

- My favorite musicians are ZAZ, Stromae, Joyce Jonathan, Alizee, Clara Luciani, and Helene Rolles. I used to enjoy the music from Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Chloe Moriondo, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Cher, and Abba. If I have to pick my favourite song, I would say it is Hero by Mariah Carey and it is also the song that my mother loves too. My favourite actresses are Natalie Portman, Jodie Comer, and Yuki Amami, and favourite actors are David Tennant and Timothee Chalamet (probably because Tea and Chai are my favourite drink). 
- I am a spontaneous and free-spirited person. I like to explore different topics. 
- I’m currently learning data science, discrete math, computational linear algebra, and computer science (C++, C#, Go, Python, SQL).
- I’m looking to collaborate on solving math or computer science problems.
