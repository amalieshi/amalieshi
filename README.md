- 👋 Hi, I’m @amalieshi
- 👀 I’m interested in reading British literature and solving puzzles. I grew up in Shenzhen, China. It is a city adjacent to Hong Kong. I later moved to the United States to complete my higher education. Surprisingly, I follow the alphabet in the city where I live, starting off with Atlanta, Georgia, and then Baltimore, Maryland. I love visiting the Smithsonian museums in Washington DC while living in Baltimore. After graduating from two of my favorite universities, I worked at a pharmaceutical manufacturing site near a waterfront town called Easton, Maryland. There I was close to two other towns - Cambridge, Maryland and Oxford, Maryland. I went there very frequently and both towns are so pretty. I am fond of my memory there. I later move to New Jersey. I worked at the proximity of the once famous Bell Lab (now the Nokia site) and lived in Edison where Thomas Edison founded his first lab there. I am very inspired by my travel to his labs at the Menlo Park and the other larger one which is a national park. I visited the larger lab during one of the free national park days. Most of the early Hollywood movies are made there! The other perk of living in New Jersey is the proximity to the New York City where I saw a lot of modern art and Broadway shows. I also get to visit Princeton University which is such a good school. I am now living in the very original Oxford in the United Kingdom, and I enjoy getting to know all the great British writers - namely, Shakespeare the bard, the Shelleys, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Virginia Woolf, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christine, and many more. Oxford is the city of dreaming spire, and I spend most of my time dreaming here. 
- 😊 My favourite dessert is Turkish delight, gourmet cheese, and soft baked biscuits. My favourite TV shows are the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, 30 Rock, and Doctor Who. I have seen a lot of theatre production, including Sounds of Music, Cats (Shenzhen Baoli Opera House), Phantom of the Opera (Fox Theatre in Atlanta), Moulin Rouge (Al Hirschfeld Theatre), Lion King (Minskoff Theatre), Wicked (Gershwin Theatre), Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Lyric Theatre), Aladdin (New Amsterdam Theatre), Waitress (Barrymore Theatre), To Kill a Mocking Bird (Shubert Theatre), Frozen (Theatre Royal Drury Lane), Jersey Boy (Trafalgar Theatre), Pretty Woman (Savoy Theatre), Mamma Mia (New Theatre Oxford).
- 🎶 My favourite singers are Taylor Swift and Chloe Moriondo, favourite actresses are Natalie Portman, Jodie Comer, and Yuki Amami, and favourite actors are David Tennant and Timothee Chalamet (probably because Tea and Chai are my favourite drink). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, discrete math, computational linear algebra, and computer science (C++, C#, Go, Python, SQL).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving math or computer science problems.
