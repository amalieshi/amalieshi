- 👋 Hi, I’m @amalieshi
- 👀 I’m interested in reading British literature and solving puzzles. I grew up in Shenzhen, China. It is a city adjacent to Hong Kong. I later moved to the United States to complete my higher education. Suprisingly enough, I follow the alphabet in the city where I live, starting off with Atlanta, Georgia, and then Baltimore, Maryland. I love visiting the Smithonian museums in Washington DC while living in Baltimore. After graduating from two of my favourite universities, I worked at a pharmaceutical manufacturing site near a waterfront town called Easton, Maryland. There I was close to two other towns - Cambridge, Maryland and Oxford, Maryland. I went there very frequently and both towns are so pretty. I am fond of my memory there. I later move to Edison, New Jersey where Thomas Edison had his first lab there. I am very inspired by my travel to his labs at the Menlo Park and the other larger one which is a national park. I visited the larger lab during one of the free national park days. Most of the early Hollywood movies are made there! The other perk of living in New Jersey is the proximity to the New York City where I saw a lot of modern art and Broadway shows. I am now living in the very original Oxford in the United Kingdom, and I enjoy getting to know all the great British writers - namely, Shakespaere the bard, Shelley, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkein, Virginia Woolf, Conan Doyle, Christine Agatha, and many more. Oxford is the city of dreaming spire, and I spend most of my time dreaming here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, discrete math, computational linear algebra, and computer science (C++, C#, Go, Python, SQL).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving math or computer science problems.
